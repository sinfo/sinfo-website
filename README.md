# SINFO Website

New SINFO website, made with Next.js.

## Getting Started

- Clone project
- `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run server (runs on port 3000 by default)

## Project Folder Structure

The following takes you through all the directories in the "src" directory and their intended usage:

### `app`

Stores all code related to the pages of the webapp, organized by directories.

Each directory in the "app" directory is mapped automatically to a route by Next.js (given that it contains a page.ts or route.ts file). For example, "app/contact/page.ts" maps to the route with path "/contact".

The "app/(root)/page.ts" maps to the route with path "/".

More on Next.js routing [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

### `assets`

Stores all static assets such as images, documents etc.

### `components`

Stores any reusable components, like buttons and UI components, that are not specific to any one page of the app and may be used throughout the application.

### `context`

Stores files related to Context API.

### `services`

Stores files related to data fetching, external API calls, etc.

### `styles`

Stores all project stylesheet files (CSS & SCSS files).

### `types`

Contains TypeScript type definitions.

**_More directories may be added for efficient project organization on as-needed basis._**
